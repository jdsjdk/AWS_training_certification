# AWS_training_certification
This is to upload all of my AWS progress onto my Github so I can track my progress. 

UPDATE:  Due to current overhead costs of running an AWS instance, plus the money involved for training - cert plus cost to run demos, I'm putting this on ice for the time being.  I'm transitioning to python ETL training instead.  This cost is next to free.
